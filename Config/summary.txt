With over a decade of experience in 3D art across industries like video games, military simulations, medical applications, and 3D printing, I specialize in creating realistic weapons and hard-surface game assets. My skill set also includes vehicle and environment art, always with a focus on optimizing for Unity, Unreal Engine, and VR applications. I’m committed to delivering high-quality visuals and immersive experiences by drawing on a solid foundation in lighting, composition, and framing—skills honed through my background in videography and film editing.

I’m passionate about learning and staying ahead in a fast-evolving field, which has helped me master tools like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max. I continuously refine my techniques in topology, baking, and lighting to ensure my work meets the highest standards.

Outside of work, I enjoy challenging myself both intellectually and physically. I believe keeping a healthy mind and body is key to staying sharp, creative, and efficient. Music is another big part of my life—I love exploring music theory and playing guitar and piano in my downtime.
