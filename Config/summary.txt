I’ve been immersed in 3D art for over a decade, working across games, military simulations, medical applications, and 3D printing. My main focus is creating realistic weapons and hard-surface assets, optimizing them for Unity, Unreal Engine, and VR. I also have experience with vehicle and environment art, always balancing detail with performance.

With a background in videography and film editing, I have a strong eye for lighting, composition, and framing—skills that help me craft immersive visuals. I’m always pushing myself to improve, whether it’s refining my topology, perfecting bakes, or mastering new tools like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max.

Outside of work, I believe in keeping both the mind and body sharp. I enjoy challenging myself physically and exploring music theory, often spending my free time playing guitar and piano.
