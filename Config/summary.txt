With over a decade of experience in 3D-art for video games, military simulations, medical industries and 3d printing, my areas of expertise include realistic weapons modeling and hard-surface game assets. Additionally, I have experience in vehicles and environment art, focusing always on optimization in Unity and Unreal Engine as well as VR applications. I ensure high-quality visuals and immersive experiences for consumers, leaning into my deep knowledge of lighting composition, framing, and general artistic vision from videography and film editing. 

My passion for creativity and affinity for learning software rapidly has led to become proficient in tools like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max. I constantly improve my processes for topology, baking, and lighting; I believe that staying current and well-versed in a variety of techniques is essential for success in today's rapidly changing world. 

In my free time, I like to keep myself both intellectually and physically stimulated; I believe a healthy mind and body helps me be efficient, creative, and sharp. Music has always been a passion of mine. I enjoy learning music theory and playing the guitar and piano.
