With over a decade of experience in 3D art across diverse industries, including video games, military simulations, medical applications, and 3D printing, I specialize in creating realistic weapons and hard-surface game assets. My expertise extends to vehicle and environment art, with a strong emphasis on optimization for Unity, Unreal Engine, and virtual reality applications. I am dedicated to delivering high-quality visuals and immersive experiences, drawing on a solid foundation in lighting, composition, and framingâ€”skills developed through my background in videography and film editing. 

I am passionate about continuous learning and staying at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field, which has enabled me to master tools such as Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max. I consistently refine my techniques in topology, baking, and lighting to ensure my work meets the highest standards. 

In my personal time, I seek to challenge myself both intellectually and physically, as I believe that maintaining a healthy mind and body is essential for creativity and efficiency. Music also plays a significant role in my life; I enjoy exploring music theory and playing guitar and piano during my leisure time.
