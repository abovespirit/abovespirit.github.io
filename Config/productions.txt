I created game-ready assets using the Nanite texturing pipeline, working with Blender’s remesher workflow for mesh preparation and laying out UVs for texturing.

I gathered references and detailed measurements from an on-site operating room to recreate the environment and implement props and tools for rendering. Collaborating with the 3D Animation Supervisor, I helped produce photorealistic renders using V-Ray. Working closely with the art and animation team, I gained valuable insights into advanced techniques and workflow processes.
