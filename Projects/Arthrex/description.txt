Arthrex

A throwback to my 2018 internship with Arthrex! This project took me back and forth from the real-life operating room upstairs, gathering reference images and measurements, and recreating the space for both visual and Virtual Reality use. I had the privilege of working alongside Patrick Eckhold. Overall this was a great experience and an even greater company.
